      <p>Basmati Rice</p>
      <p>Ingredients:</p>
      <p>1 cups basmati rice</p>
      <p>5 cups water to cook the rice</p>
      <p>1 stick cinnamon cut into 3 small pieces</p>
      <p>2 pieces cloves Optional</p>
      <p>2 pieces cardamom pods opened with seeds still inside (optional)</p>
      <p>1/2 tsp ghee Optional</p>
      <p>2 strands of Saffron threads Optional</p>
      <p>water to rinse the rice</p>
      <p>Instructions</p>
      <p>In a medium sauce pan, add 1 cup of Basmati rice</p>
      <p>Place the pan under your kitchen tap and fill it halfway with water</p>
      <p>Using your fingers, gently stir the rice and water.</p>
      <p>Tilt the pan and remove as much of the water as you can. It’s ok to leave some water in it.</p>
      <p>Repeat steps 2 to 4 two more times. The water will be less cloudy at the third time</p>
      <p>Once washed, we now add water that was set aside for cooking</p>
      <p>Place the pan on high heat.</p>
      <p>Add the cloves, cardamom, cinnamon and ghee or oil.</p>
      <p>Stir frequently so that the rice doesn’t stick to the bottom</p>
      <p>When the rice grains have doubled in size (about 15 min), turn off heat</p>
      <p>Using a strainer, strain the rice to remove excess water</p>
      <p>Use a fork to stir the rice in the strainer to make it fluffy</p>
      <p>Transfer to a serving bowl and enjoy</p>
