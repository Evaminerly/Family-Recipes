      <p>Pernil</p>
      <p>This pernil recipe calls for about 6 hours at 300°F. Then give it a 45 minute hit at 350°F for a more intense final crust</p>
      <p>Ingredients:</p>
      <p>1 (7-pound) bone in or boneless pork shoulder</p>
      <p>¼ cup vegetable or canola oil</p>
      <p>12 cloves garlic (minced)</p>
      <p>¼ cup fresh oregano leaves</p>
      <p>1 tablespoon dried oregano</p>
      <p>2 tablespoons Adobo seasoning (the powdered canned kind)</p>
      <p>1 tablespoon paprika</p>
      <p>1 teaspoon kosher salt (plus more for seasoning at the end)</p>
      <p>½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper (plus more for seasoning at the end)</p>
      <p>Juice of 2 lemons and 1 orange</p>
      <p>Instructions:</p>
      <p>1. Score the fat on the pork shoulder in a criss-cross hatch fashion. Then, cut deeply once in each direction across the pork, 
        like you are going to cut it into four quarters, but then leave them attached at the bottom. Use a sharp knife to make about 20 slits,
        about 1 inch deep, all over the meat. Place the meat in a 13 x 9 baking pan or another shallow baking pan large enough to comfortably hold 
        the meat with some space around it.</p>
      <p>2. Combine the oil, garlic, fresh and dried oregano, Adobo, paprika, salt and pepper. Rub the mixture all over the meat, working it all 
            over the surface and into the slits. Cover the pork with foil and refrigerate overnight.</p>
      <p>3. Bring the pork to room temperature, about 1 hour. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 300 F. Bake the pork, covered for 3 hours, then remove 
        the foil and bake for another 3 to 4 hours at the same temperature, until the pork is fall-apart tender. The internal temperature should be 
        at least 165 F, but it may be higher, which is fine — it’s most important that the meat is super tender. If you would like a crustier exterior, 
        turn the heat to 375 F and bake for another 20 to 30 minutes, until the outside of the pork has a nice browned crust.</p>
      <p>4. Let the pernil sit for at least 20 minutes, then use your fingers (if it’s not too hot; some people like to wear kitchen gloves to protect 
        their fingers from the heat) or two forks to pull the meat into chunks. Sprinkle the meat with the lemon and orange juice, season with additional 
        salt and pepper, and serve hot or warm.</p>
